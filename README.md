- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jassica.
- ðŸ‘€ I am a young, passionate, and dedicated data science enthusiast with 5+ years of experience in meteorological data analysis. 
- ðŸŒ± I also strive to gain more knowledge about the wide use of machine learning and deep learning for climate-related research and projects to expand my skill set in becoming a successful climate data scientist. Currently, I am working with big data from CMIP6 simulation using the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model for bias-correction purposes to investigate the impact of climate change on solar energy potential in Indonesia.
